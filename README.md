React Project: State of the Art Web Development
===============================================

A dependency--not a boilerplate--to make your React project a delight to
develop.

This is brand new, not ready for production unless you are ready and
willing to contribute to the project. Basically just building something
we want here, if it interests you, please help :)

Also, it has no tests. Also, it's kind of awesome.

## Node/NPM Versions

User PC should have Node.js installed




## Getting Started

Inside the root folder run:

```sh
npm install
npm start
```


Now open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).
